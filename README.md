# ExGen-Client
Our implementation of how ExGen should work

todo list:
- [x] create html page for professor, admin, and course reps
-[ ] setup sqlalchemy instead of jkust querying sql
- [ ] general code for routes.py
- [ ] secret issue on github
- [ ] python emailing (resetting password)
- [ ] exam codes
- [ ] results code
- [ ] search bars for modules

secret.txt is the file containing all the passwords / usernames
secret.txt looks like:
> brandon@skerritt.tech\n
> thisIsMyPassword\n
where \n is an actual new line (not the charecters)
